# Pico Synthesiser
## Description
In this task you will make a synthesiser using the PWM and a light dependent resistor. You will need to implement the function `pwm_set_freq(uint32_t freq)` to set the PWM to generate a wave at the given frequency and then create a small circuit to input an adjustable voltage into the ADC.
